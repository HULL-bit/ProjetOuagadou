# Overview

PIROGUE-SMART is a comprehensive maritime management system designed for fishermen in Senegal. The platform combines traditional fishing practices with modern technology, providing real-time tracking, emergency alerts, weather monitoring, and communication tools. The system serves fishermen, organizations (GIE), and administrators with role-based interfaces and features.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and modern development patterns
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom maritime and African-inspired color themes
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and micro-interactions
- **React Context API** for state management (AuthContext, DataContext)
- **Component-based architecture** with reusable UI components

## Backend Options
The system supports two backend architectures:

### Option 1: Django REST Framework (Recommended)
- **Django 5.0** with Django REST Framework for API development
- **PostgreSQL with PostGIS** for geospatial data handling

- **Celery with Redis** for background task processing

### Option 2: Supabase Backend-as-a-Service
- **PostgreSQL with PostGIS** managed by Supabase
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for data access control
- **Real-time subscriptions** for live updates
- **Built-in authentication** and user management
- **File storage** for avatars and chat attachments

## Data Architecture

- **Real-time location tracking** with geographic data types
- **Zone management** for safety, fishing, and restricted areas
- **Alert system** with severity levels and status tracking
- **Trip history** with detailed metrics and analytics
- **Communication system** with channels and direct messaging

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-role system** with distinct interfaces and permissions
